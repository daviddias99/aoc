# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repository contains my yearly attempts at solving the AoC challenges. I've never made it to the end, but maybe one day... Anyway, so far I've been doing it by following a challenge some colleagues of mine created: each year doing the AoC puzzles using a programming language I don't know and am curious about. I feel I won't always do this, but let's see.

**Previous years:**

- 2019 - Python
- 2020 - Lua
- 2021 - Scala/Julia
- 2023 - Golang
